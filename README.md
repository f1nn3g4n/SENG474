# SENG474

All course assignments for SENG474: Data Mining and Machine Learning, UVIC F2022.

Some assignments refer to .csv files from my Random CSV's repo. I may remove this repo at some point, but typically a different question from the assignment generates the needed .csv (if you need them).

Each folder contains the assignment description and assignment files, broken down into one file per problem. I will also upload the feedback I get for my work.

Clearly there are some incomplete/incorrect subproblem solutions here. At some point I might try to fix them, but at this point the repo is more so meant to offer some code samples and highlight some experiences I have had, over providing thorough solutions to these problems.
