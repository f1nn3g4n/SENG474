Support\n","2. Confidence\n","3. Lift\n","\n","**Example:**\n","Suppose we have a record of 1 thousand customer transactions, and we want to find the Support, Confidence, and Lift for two items e.g. burgers and ketchup. Out of one thousand transactions, 100 contain ketchup while 150 contain a burger. Out of 150 transactions where a burger is purchased, 50 transactions contain ketchup as well.\n","\n","**1. Support:**\n","Support refers to the default popularity of an item and can be calculated by finding number of transactions containing a particular item divided by total number of transactions. For instance, if out of 1000 transactions, 100 transactions contain Ketchup then the support for item Ketchup can be calculated as 100/1000=10%. <br>\n","**2. Confidence:**\n","Confidence refers to the likelihood that an item B is also bought if item A is bought. It can be calculated by finding the number of transactions where A and B are bought together, divided by total number of transactions where A is bought. <br>\n","Coming back to our problem, we had 50 transactions where Burger and Ketchup were bought together. While in 150 transactions, burgers are bought. Then we can find likelihood of buying ketchup when a burger is bought can be represented as confidence of Burger -> Ketchup and can be mathematically written as: 50/150=33.3%. <br>\n","**3. Lift:**\n","Lift(A -> B) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold. Lift(A –> B) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(A -> B) divided by Support(B). <br>\n","Coming back to our Burger and Ketchup problem, the Lift(Burger -> Ketchup) can be calculated as 33.3/10=3.33. <br>\n","Lift basically tells us that the likelihood of buying a Burger and Ketchup together is 3.33 times more than the likelihood of just buying the ketchup. <br>\n","If Lift=1 -> no association between products A and B. <br> \n","If Lift>1 -> products A and B are more likely to be bought together.  \n","If Lift<1 -> two products are unlikely to be bought together. <br>\n","\n","For instance, Lift can be calculated for item 1 and item 2, item 1 and item 3, item 1 and item 4 and then item 2 and item 3, item 2 and item 4 and then combinations of items e.g. item 1, item 2 and item 3; similarly item 1, item2, and item 4, and so on.\n","\n","--------------------------------------------\n","As you can see from the above example, this process can be extremely slow due to the number of combinations. To speed up the process, we need to perform the following steps:\n","\n","1. Set a minimum value for support and confidence. This means that we are only interested in finding rules for the items that have certain default existence (e.g. support) and have a minimum value for co-occurrence with other items (e.g. confidence).\n","2. Extract all the subsets having higher value of support than minimum threshold.\n","3. Select all the rules from the subsets with confidence value higher than minimum threshold.\n","4. Order the rules by descending order of Lift, e.g. 3.33, 2.13, 1.34, etc.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"i78JP_0ptQDp","outputId":"8e64584e-9b44-4167-faf5-ac64eab073bc"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: apyori in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (1.1.2)\n"]}],"source":["# install apyori packages (https://github.com/ymoch/apyori, https://github.com/chonyy/apriori_python)\n","!pip3 install apyori"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pbJ60uSPt2c7"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import pandas as pd\n","from apyori import apriori"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"92CZhOegut-T"},"outputs":[],"source":["store_data = pd.read_csv('/content/store_data.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":292},"id":"SjEYp11Cut0j","outputId":"32a3c056-bcb9-4509-dfb6-4334cedab673"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>shrimp</th>\n","      <th>almonds</th>\n","      <th>avocado</th>\n","      <th>vegetables mix</th>\n","      <th>green grapes</th>\n","      <th>whole weat flour</th>\n","      <th>yams</th>\n","      <th>cottage cheese</th>\n","      <th>energy drink</th>\n","      <th>tomato juice</th>\n","      <th>low fat yogurt</th>\n","      <th>green tea</th>\n","      <th>honey</th>\n","      <th>salad</th>\n","      <th>mineral water</th>\n","      <th>salmon</th>\n","      <th>antioxydant juice</th>\n","      <th>frozen smoothie</th>\n","      <th>spinach</th>\n","      <th>olive oil</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>burgers</td>\n","      <td>meatballs</td>\n","      <td>eggs</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>chutney</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>turkey</td>\n","      <td>avocado</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>mineral water</td>\n","      <td>milk</td>\n","      <td>energy bar</td>\n","      <td>whole wheat rice</td>\n","      <td>green tea</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>low fat yogurt</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["           shrimp    almonds     avocado  ... frozen smoothie spinach olive oil\n","0         burgers  meatballs        eggs  ...
